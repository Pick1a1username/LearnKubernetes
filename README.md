For original source code, refer to [this link](https://github.com/Praqma/LearnKubernetes/commit/9c90b617e92a965fdfc4f6baec7a4aa961c74ae8).




## Purpose

The purpose of this folk is to rewrite [Kubernetes The Hard Way - Bare Metal](https://github.com/Praqma/LearnKubernetes/blob/9c90b617e92a965fdfc4f6baec7a4aa961c74ae8/kamran/Kubernetes-The-Hard-Way-on-BareMetal.md).

The major changes planned will be:

* using packages and OS used in CKA exam
* completing incomplete explanation(sometimes checked as *(ToDo)*)
* adding additional desciptions that would be helpful to CKA examinees.
* using RBAC, not ABAC
* splitting one page into multiple pages, like [original](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way).

# LearnKubernetes

Notes and resources collected together to help learn Kubernetes. This will eventually become a tutorial and later a blog post for praqma website (hopefully!)

At the moment, people contributing to this repo, please create separate directories with your name and put your stuff into your directory. One of the ideas is to save your notes in this repo instead of (in addition to) your computer so we are protected against accidents like hardware failures and theft, etc.
