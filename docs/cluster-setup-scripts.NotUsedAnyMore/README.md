# Important
* The nodes need to have SSH key pre-installed. This is done by the provisioning system.
* The SSL certificates need to be generated beforehand, so they could be copied into each node, before the node configuration can start.
* The hosts file is an intelligent file here. It contains the columns which contain the amount of RAM and disk needed for each node.
