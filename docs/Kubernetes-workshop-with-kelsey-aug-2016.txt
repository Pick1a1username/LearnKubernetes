shows all api calls in curl format.



readiness and liveliness (liveness) probes should be part of all pod definitions.

You have exposed your service on an external port on all nodes in your
cluster.  If you want to expose this service to the external internet, you may
need to set up firewall rules for the service port(s) (tcp:31000) to serve traffic.
See http://releases.k8s.io/release-1.3/docs/user-guide/services-firewalls.md for more details.

kubectl get endpoints give the endpoints of a service. Super helpful in my load balancer.

kubectl describe limitranges limits is a good place to set defaults for resource usage.



git kelseyhightower/kube-cert-manager is a way to automatically generate the certs and push it to apps, using letsencrypt.
